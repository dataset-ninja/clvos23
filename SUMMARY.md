**CLVOS23: A Long Video Object Segmentation Dataset for Continual Learning** is a dataset for semantic segmentation and object detection tasks. It is applicable or relevant across various domains. 

The dataset consists of 13362 images with 284 labeled objects belonging to 5 different classes including *person*, *dressage*, *rat*, and other: *car* and *dog*.

Images in the CLVOS23 dataset have pixel-level semantic segmentation annotations. There are 13078 (98% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are no pre-defined <i>train/val/test</i> splits in the dataset. Alternatively, the dataset could be split into 9 videos names: ***dressage*** (3589 images), ***blueboy*** (2406 images), ***parkour boy*** (1578 images), ***rat*** (1416 images), ***car*** (1109 images), ***skiing slalom*** (903 images), ***dog*** (891 images), ***skating*** (778 images), and ***skiing*** (692 images). The dataset was released in 2023 by the <span style="font-weight: 600; color: grey; border-bottom: 1px dashed #d3d3d3;">University of Waterloo, Canada</span>.
